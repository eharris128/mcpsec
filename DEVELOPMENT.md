# Development Guide

This guide covers how to run and develop the MCP Security Research site locally.

## Prerequisites

- Ruby (version 2.7 or higher)
- Bundler gem (`gem install bundler`)
- Git

## Local Development Setup

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/eharris128/mcpsec.git
   cd mcpsec
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   bundle install
   ```

3. **Run the site locally**
   ```bash
   bundle exec jekyll serve
   ```

4. **View the site**
   - Open your browser to `http://localhost:4000`
   - The site will automatically rebuild when you make changes
   - RSS feed available at `http://localhost:4000/rss` or `http://localhost:4000/feed.xml`

└── about.md               # About page
```

## Adding a New Advisory

1. Create a new file in `_advisories/` with the naming format:
   ```
   YYYY-MM-DD-short-title.md
   ```

2. Add front matter at the top of the file:
   ```yaml
   ---
   layout: post
   title: "Full Advisory Title"
   date: YYYY-MM-DD
   categories: [category1, category2, security]
   excerpt: "Brief description of the vulnerability"
   ---
   ```

3. Write your advisory content in Markdown below the front matter

4. Test locally with `bundle exec jekyll serve`

5. Commit and push to deploy

## Deployment

The site is deployed via GitHub Pages:
- **Production URL:** https://mcpsec.dev
- **Custom domain:** Configured via CNAME file
- **Deployment trigger:** Automatic on push to `master` branch

GitHub Pages automatically builds and deploys the site when changes are pushed to the master branch.

## Configuration

Key configuration settings in `_config.yml`:
- Site title and description
- Social media links
- Navigation menu items
- Collection settings for advisories
- Permalink structure
- RSS feed configuration (includes advisories collection)

## RSS Feed

The site provides an RSS/Atom feed for all security advisories:
- **Primary feed:** `https://mcpsec.dev/feed.xml`
- **Alias:** `https://mcpsec.dev/rss`

The feed is automatically generated by `jekyll-feed` and includes all advisories from the `_advisories` collection. New advisories are automatically added to the feed when published.

## Troubleshooting

**Site not building locally?**
- Ensure all dependencies are installed: `bundle install`
- Check Ruby version: `ruby --version`
- Clear Jekyll cache: `bundle exec jekyll clean`

**Changes not appearing on live site?**
- Check GitHub Pages build status in repository settings
- Verify changes were pushed to master branch
- GitHub Pages may take a few minutes to rebuild

**404 errors for new advisories?**
- Verify file is in `_advisories/` directory
- Check front matter is properly formatted
- Ensure filename follows YYYY-MM-DD format
- Push a trivial commit to trigger rebuild if needed
